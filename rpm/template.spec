%description
hector_object_tracker is the core package of hector_worldmodel. It listens to
percept message from detectors (e.g. heat signatures of persons or recognitions
of other objects of interest in the scene) and fuses all information to a single
worldmodel state. Objects will be tracked over time and their states can be
influenced by a couple of services. The percept to object association problem is
solved either automatically based on the Mahalanobis distance, or a unique
object_id can be given in the percept message. If a
hector_nav_msgs/GetDistanceToObstacle service is available, the object_tracker
can optionally deduce the depth of objects in the scene by projection to the
nearest obstacle (wall).
